## ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your machine before proceeding:

| Requirement | Minimum Version | Download |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Python | 3.9+ | https://www.python.org/downloads/ |
| pip | Latest | Bundled with Python |
| Git (optional) | Any | https://git-scm.com/ |

> **Windows users:** During Python installation, make sure to tick **"Add Python to PATH"**.

---

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone or Download the Project

```bash
# Option A — Clone via Git
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd purchasing-tendency

# Option B — Navigate to the folder directly (if already downloaded)
cd path\to\purchasing_tendency
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

> Once activated, your terminal prompt will show `(.venv)` as a prefix.

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ⚠️ **Note on `torch-geometric`:** On Windows, installing `torch-geometric` may require extra steps depending on your PyTorch version and CUDA availability. If the standard install fails, follow the official guide:  
> 👉 https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html

**For CPU-only (no GPU) environments, you can install PyTorch first:**
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install torch-geometric
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Verify the Database Exists

The SQLite database `purchasing_tendency.db` should already be present in the project root. If it is missing, the app will fail to start.

```bash
# Confirm the file exists
dir purchasing_tendency.db        # Windows
```

### 6. Verify Dataset Files

The following CSV files must exist inside `static/data/`:

- `dataset.csv`
- `ecommerce_behavior_dataset.csv`
- `ecommerce_dataset_fixed.csv`

If any are missing, the application will raise a `FileNotFoundError` on startup.

## 🚀 Running the Application

With the virtual environment **activated** and all dependencies installed:

```bash
python app.py
```

Expected output:

```
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Debug mode: on
```

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## 🧠 Deep Learning Models

The application uses two pre-trained deep learning models stored in `dl_models/`:

### TendGraphNet (Graph Neural Network)
- Builds a bipartite user–product interaction graph
- Uses two-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) via `torch_geometric`
- Pre-trained weights: `dl_models/tendgraphnet.pth`

### SeqBehNet (Sequential Behaviour Network)
- SASRec-style Transformer Encoder for sequential purchase prediction
- Predicts the next likely product based on a buyer's history
- Pre-trained weights: `dl_models/seqbehnet.pth`

> The `.pth` weight files are already included — **you do not need to retrain the models** to run the application.

## 📊 Dataset Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `dataset.csv` | District-level product purchase counts used for demand insights |
| `ecommerce_behavior_dataset.csv` | User behavior events (views, cart adds, purchases) |
| `ecommerce_dataset_fixed.csv` | Cleaned full dataset used for demand alert generation |

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch_geometric'`
Install `torch-geometric` following the [official instructions](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html) for your OS and PyTorch version.

### `FileNotFoundError: static/data/dataset.csv`
Ensure all three CSV files are present inside `static/data/`. Do not rename or move them.

### `sqlite3.OperationalError`
Confirm that `purchasing_tendency.db` exists in the project root directory and has not been corrupted.

### Virtual environment not activating on PowerShell
Run the following command once to allow script execution:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Port already in use
If port `5000` is occupied, run Flask on a different port:
```bash
flask run --port 5001
```

## 📧 Email Configuration

The app uses Gmail SMTP to send seller demand alert emails. The SMTP credentials are pre-configured in `app.py`. If you wish to use your own Gmail account, update the following in `app.py`:

```python
app.config['MAIL_USERNAME'] = 'your-email@gmail.com'
app.config['MAIL_PASSWORD'] = 'your-app-password'
app.config['MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER'] = 'your-email@gmail.com'
```

> Use a [Gmail App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) — not your regular Gmail password.
